  <h1>Open Source Execution Runtime</h1>

The execution architecture, which provides the runtime environment for CogIMon systems consists of three layers: real-time execution, non-real-time execution, and coordination execution.

## Real-time execution

For the real-time execution the [Orocos Real-Time Toolkit](http://www.orocos.org/rtt) (RTT) is used. It provides a C++ framework for realtime control systems. Combined with the [Orocos Kinematics and Dynamics Library](http://www.orocos.org/kdl) (KDL) it lays the foundation to implement the motion- / force-control architecture.

## Non-real-time execution

For the non-real-time critical parts of the architecture, either [YARP](http://www.yarp.it/) modules or [RSB](http://docs.cor-lab.org/rsb-manual/trunk/html/) services are used, which are encapsulated in and run as regular Linux processes. These high-level components are integrated with the real-time execution via interprocess communication and the respective OROCOS-RTT transport implementations.

<!-- the [Compliant Control Architecture](http://docs.cor-lab.org/cca-manual/0.3/html/) (CCA), developed in the [AMARSi](https://www.amarsi-project.eu/) project, is utilized.  -->

## Coordination execution

The artifacts generated by the coordination DSLs are currently interpreted with the [SCXML-Engine](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-scxml/guide/core-engine.html). The counterparts to the coordination extension DSLs are implemented as plugins for the SCXML Engine. This way the engine is able to interact with the Real-time execution as well as the Non-real-time execution parts. In the future, we may utilize rFSM or other approaches that provider stronger guarantees in terms of execution semantics.
